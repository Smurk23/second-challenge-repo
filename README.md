In this challenege I was able to create a portfolio in which upon getting to my page you are able to see my name, a picture of me, and links that if clicked will navigate you to the respective article.

I was able to take a photo of my first project and use that not only as an image on the page but also as a link when clicking on the photo.

At the bottom of my portfolio as I added links to my phone number, email, and github if anybody wanted to contact me.

Heres a screenshot of my deployed page! https://1drv.ms/i/s!AjoffCMx8g__gUpfzBPL_zNF2Hlo?e=xxrQLr
