            <p>Hi! My name is Xing Cantres. I am 26 years. I reside and have lived my whole life in New Haven, Connecticut. I'm a strong minded, family oriented individual. I believe that with hard work and dedication anything is achievable, I strongly believe there are no limitations to what we as people can accomplish! As a child I grew up in a very modest way, not always able to get what we wanted but understanding the sacrifices that were made just to get what we had. I believe this only fueled a fire in me to be great.</p>
